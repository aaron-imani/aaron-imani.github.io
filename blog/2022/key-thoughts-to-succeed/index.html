In this story, I will briefly share the thoughts that have helped me so far to become successful in reaching my life goals. These thoughts might appear simple initially, but adhering to them requires practice.</p> <h3>1- Think BIG, SET a Goal.</h3> <p>It is essential to set goals for our foreseeable future. Some people spend their days one after the other without knowing that they are always making transitions in different phases of their life. Therefore, it is crucial to always think of “What comes next?”, “What is my next step?”, “After finishing this phase, what am I willing to do?”. I have seen many people who, by the time they have come up with a goal, have lost so much time that could have been spent trying to reach the goal.</p> <p>The other aspect that should be considered is how big we think when defining goals for our life. Small goals seem more reachable to our minds, making us not try hard enough to reach them. When the goal seems enormous to us, it becomes a big deal when we think of it, and consequently, we will try harder to reach it because we know it will not be easy to make that happen!</p> <h3>2- Set Proper PRIORITIES.</h3> <p>It is OK to start learning Piano, but when you have a University entrance test within 6 months from now, doing so does not seem like the best decision. Setting proper priorities is a must when it comes to planning to reach a goal. One might complain that “what if I am too focused on my goal?”, “I am not living a good life”, etc. Since nothing will happen unless the required steps have been taken and we got 24 hours a day to live, we are always sacrificing some of our favourite activities in the short term to reach a goal that affects our life in the long term. Note that if our goal is not BIG enough for ourselves, it will be hard to put the required activities to reach it as our high-priority daily tasks.</p> <h3>3- Always Do your BEST!</h3> <p>When doing anything, always do your best. This is one of the key thoughts that has always helped me during my life. Putting your maximum effort into something will have a high chance of making your results the best among those doing the same thing without putting their best effort into it. One is unlikely to achieve the best results without doing their best. Furthermore, <strong>if you do not do your best, you are not making the best use of your time.</strong></p> <h3>4- Do the HARD thing!</h3> <p>One of the many reasons there aren’t a million Elon Musks out there is that people naturally avoid doing hard things! When they are students, they try to get the minimum score that won’t affect their studies; Their work is as good as not being fired when they are employees. Therefore, one of the most obvious yet most difficult ways to succeed is to find those <strong>hard things that no one else would ever think of doing</strong>, and pursue them. A hard path has the advantage that few people are racing against you on it, so you have <strong>fewer rivals</strong> and, as a result, a higher chance of winning!</p> <h3>5- Always IMAGINE the time/moment you have reached your goal.</h3> <p>When one is working hard to achieve their goal, it is necessary to create and retain a variety of motivations. Imagining the time/moment when the goal you are working toward has occurred is an effective method of staying motivated while trying hard. Make it <strong>believable</strong> for yourself by <strong>picturing it in the most detail possible.</strong> This will not only keep you motivated to reach your goal but will also keep your life focused on achieving what you have imagined in your mind.</p> <p>These are some of the most important thoughts I have had that have led me to where I stand. If you do not mind sharing your ideas, I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts!</p> <h3>References</h3> <p>1- <a href="https://custom-cursor.com/fr/collection/spongebob/sb-plankton-secret-formula" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://custom-cursor.com/fr/collection/spongebob/sb-plankton-secret-formula</a></p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=484bdb3ef300" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
