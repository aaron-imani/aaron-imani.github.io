Hey! I'm a Ph.D. student in Software Engineering at UC Irvine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, where I work with [Dr. Mohammad Moshirpour](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moshirpour) in the [SEPE Lab](https://moshirpour.com). My research dives into how different factors affect large language modelsâ€™ ability to understand code ðŸ¤–ðŸ’­<i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-code"></i>. Before this, I did my Masterâ€™s in Software Engineering at the University of Calgary ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.
