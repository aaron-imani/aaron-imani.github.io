Hey! I'm a Ph.D. student in Software Engineering at UC Irvine, where I work with [Dr. Mohammad Moshirpour](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moshirpour) in the [SEPE Lab](https://moshirpour.com). My research dives into how different factors affect large language models’ ability to understand code 🧠. Before this, I did my Master’s in Software Engineering at the University of Calgary.

Curious about what I’ve been working on? Feel free to check out my resume using the button below! You can also find a complete list of my peer-reviewed publications [here](/publications).
