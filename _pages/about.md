I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Software Engineering at the University of California, Irvine, where I work under the guidance of Dr. Mohammad Moshirpour in the [SEPE lab](https://moshirpour.com). My research focuses on analyzing the impact factors on large language models' code comprehension ðŸ§ . Prior to joining UC Irvine, I completed my masterâ€™s degree in Software Engineering at the University of Calgary.
